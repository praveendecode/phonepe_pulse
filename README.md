## Overview

    This project aims to create an interactive data visualization tool for the Phonepe Pulse data available on GitHub. The tool provides user-friendly access to various metrics and statistics.


## Features

       Data Extraction: Automates the process of fetching data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.
       
       Data Transformation: Cleans and processes the data using Python and Pandas.
       
       Database Integration: Stores the cleaned data in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval.
       
       Interactive Dashboard: Presents data using Streamlit and Plotly, offering dynamic visualizations.
       
       Data Retrieval: Connects to the MySQL database to display data on the dashboard.
       
       Customization: Offers more interactive options for users to select different data visualizations.


## Getting Started
    
    Clone the GitHub repository.
    
    Use Python, Pandas, and mysql-connector-python for data processing.
    
    Set up the MySQL database for data storage.
    
    Create the interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
    
    Fetch data from the database for dashboard updates.

## Technical Steps to Execute the Project

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

    Before running the project, make sure to install the necessary libraries mentioned in the Dashboard.py file.

### Step 2: Execute ETL Process

    Use the ETL.py file to perform the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process on the Phonepe Pulse data.

### Step 3: Run the Dashboard

    Fork the Dashboard folder and run it in your local integrated development environment (IDE).

### Step 4: Utilize the Phonepe_pulse Class

    In this project, a Phonepe_pulse class has been created to manage the methods and processes.

### Methods:

    Dashboard: This method contains the code for the interactive dashboard, where data visualizations are presented.

        Note: Streamlit is used in this project to make our code visually appealing and to provide an eye-catching data presentation.
